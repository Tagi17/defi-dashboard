# borrow screen
1. Currently borrowed amount - variable debt token erc20 balance
2. Available to borrow amount - getUserDataCollat.availableToBorrowBase
    a. getUserData.availableToBorrowBase (the US dollar worth of your deposit). 
        if you had 0.5 WETH deposited, and the price of 1 WETH is $4000,
        availableToBorrowBase is 2000
    b. then divide availableTokenBase / 10**27 = scaledNumber
        availableTokenBase = 20000000000000000000
        after dividing it should be like 2000
    c. Then take the number after dividing and then divide it by the dollar worth
    of 1 unit.
        Soo if availableToBorrowBase is 2000, and ether is $4000
    d. you are able to borrow 0.5 eth

3. APR - you get it from reserveData and it be super high number you need to divide(format)
